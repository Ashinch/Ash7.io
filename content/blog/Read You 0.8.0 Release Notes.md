## 0.8.0

1. Add German translation (thank you Dave)
2. Refactor reading page render (thanks to Feeder's open source code)
3. Add scrolling indicator bar for reading page (thanks to Matt Vaughn and Albert Chang. for reference only, because there is no Google's API, can only be implemented manually)
4. Add share article feature
5. Add article thumbnail previews (only valid for articles newly synced since this release)
6. Other detail changes

### Notes

1. This version is a little laggy, found a lot of problems, the next version will optimize and reformate the code
2. It takes three months before you can start contributing translations (Weblate's requirement for open source projects)
